=============================

This is the repository of the Agile Manufacturing team that works on a 
flexible software architecture called REXOS.

REXOS is the hybrid ROS/MAS operating system that controls an Equiplet(Production Machine).
The MAS (Multi Agent System) takes care of all cognitive decisions, while ROS (Robot Operating System) 
is used to create a stable and performant platform that interacts with the hardware.

*REXOS specifications*

* Distributed control system â€“ which limits complexity
* Dynamic product manufacturing
* Easy prototyping
* Automatic scheduling of manufacturing (products negotiate directly when they are manufactured with the manufacturing systems)
* Automatic calibration of production system
* Automatic scalability (from single product batches to large batches)
