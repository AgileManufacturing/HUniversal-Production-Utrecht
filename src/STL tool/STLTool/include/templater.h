     * [0-1] = distance
     * [0-1][0-35] = rotation
     * [0-1][0-35][0...n] = pixel info
     * @param arms The number of arms that the gripper has.
     * @param armHeight The height of the tip of each arm.
     * @param armWidth The width of the tip of each arm.
     * @param maxDist The maximum expansion distance.
     * @return Returns a gripper template.

     * not fit it will attempt to fit the maximum expansion distance templates. In case the maximum
     * distance template does fit the pixel wil be deemed as a possible location to pick up the part.

     * @return Returns a pair of the best co√∂rdinate and rotation for picking up the part.
