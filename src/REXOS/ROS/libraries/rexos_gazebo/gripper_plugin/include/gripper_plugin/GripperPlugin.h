/**
 * @file GripperPlugin.h
 * @brief The gripper plugin is used to allow grippers to dynamically and fully automatically attach to other models (collisions). 
 * The grippers can be activated by calling a service. This service will be advertised as a modbus command and advertised at address specified in the SDF file.
 * The gripper plugin is designed to be used with the @link rexos_io library
